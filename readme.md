This is my ergodox keymap:
- Purple keys are "double tap to activate mode" keys.
- Orange keys are "hold to activate mode" keys.


### Dual keys mode

In dual key mode, yellow keys are modifiers on hold, regular keys on tap:
- Index fingers are CTRL
- Middle fingers are ALT
- Ring fingers are GUI
- Pinkies are ALTGR
Thumb keys are also modified in dual keys mode to add a tab/enter keys on shift and shift on space keys.
